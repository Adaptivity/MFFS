Building
--------
Because MFFS uses the new Gradle build system for Forge, building your own copy is easier than ever!

```sh
gradle setupDevWorkspace
gradle build
```

Once you've built like this, you can grab the reobfuscated, deobfuscated, javadoc and source JAR files from the _build/libs_ directory.
